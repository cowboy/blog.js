<p>Hello everyone! Welcome to the start of blog.js, a blogging engine based on <a href="www.nodejs.org">node.js</a>. The <a href="http://github.com/furtivefelon/blog.js">code</a> is currently resides at github, and is released under MIT/BSD license. It is my hope that this blogging framework will be a good example of how to build a full-fledged web application using node js (and a custom framework that anyone can use tentatively named b.js.</p>
<p>On this page, you can play around with the current version of blog.js, and if you have any questions, please direct it to the github page. I (jasonwang), also hang out in #node.js at irc.freenode.net</p>
